What are branching and merging?

Branching is like creating a separate, independent line of development from your main project. Think of it 
as making a copy of your codebase at a specific point in time so you can work on new features or bug fixes 
without affecting the main version of your project. This allows multiple people to work on different things 
simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. The main branch is the default branch in Git and 
is generally considered the stable, production-ready version of your code.

Merging is the process of combining the changes from one branch into another. Once you've finished working 
on a new feature or bug fix on your separate branch and it's stable, you'll want to integrate those changes 
back into the main branch. Merging takes all the commits from your feature branch and applies them to the 
target branch, effectively bringing your new work into the main codebase.

Creating a branch in GitLab

In GitLab, creating a new branch is a simple process. First, navigate to your project's repository. You'll 
see a dropdown menu that shows the current branch (usually main). Click on it and then type the name you 
want for your new branch in the search box. For example, you might name it feature/add-user-authentication. 
After typing the name, a button will appear that says "Create branch: [your branch name]". Click on that 
button, and GitLab will create a new branch based on the current branch you were on.

Creating a merge request in GitLab

A merge request (MR) in GitLab is a formal way to propose that your changes from a branch be merged into 
another branch, typically the main branch. It's a key part of the collaboration workflow. To create one, 
first, push your branch with all your changes to GitLab. Then, navigate to the repository on the GitLab web 
interface. GitLab will often show a banner at the top of the page that says "You pushed to [your branch name]. 
Create merge request." Click on this button.

Alternatively, you can go to the "Merge Requests" section from the left-hand navigation menu and click 
"New merge request." You'll be asked to select a source branch (your new branch) and a target branch (e.g., main). 
After selecting the branches, you'll be taken to a page where you can fill out details about your merge request, 
such as a title, a description of the changes, and assign reviewers. This is where you explain what you 
did and why, making it easy for others to review your code before it gets merged.
