Explain different sorting algorithms
Here is an explanation of a few common ways to sort data, like customer orders.

Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is the slow and steady approach. It plods through the list of orders over and over, comparing two at a time. If an order is more expensive than the one next to it, they swap places. With each pass, the next most expensive order "bubbles" up to its final spot. It’s easy to picture, but painfully slow for lots of orders.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

Insertion Sort
This is like sorting a hand of playing cards. You take one order at a time and just slide it into its proper place within the orders you've already sorted. It's pretty quick for small lists but bogs down when the list of orders gets long.
Time Complexity: O(n²)

Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a "divide and conquer" strategy. You take your big pile of orders and split it in half, again and again, until you just have single orders. Then, you start merging them back together in pairs, making sure each little pair is sorted. You keep merging the sorted pairs until you're back to one big, perfectly sorted list.
Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Quick Sort
Quick Sort is also a "divide and conquer" method and is usually the fastest of the bunch. You pick one order to be your "pivot," and then quickly move everything cheaper to its left and everything more expensive to its right. Now you have two smaller messes to sort. You just repeat that process on the smaller piles until everything is in its right place.
Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n²) in the worst case.

Compare the performance (time complexity) of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort
When it comes to performance, the difference between Bubble Sort and Quick Sort is significant.

Bubble Sort's Problem: Its performance is what we call O(n²). In simple terms, if you double your orders, the sorting time quadruples. This quadratic growth means it becomes very inefficient as the list of orders grows.

Quick Sort's Edge: Its average performance is O(n log n), which is vastly better. It handles large lists with speed and efficiency because the time it takes to sort grows much more slowly than Bubble Sort's. While it does have a theoretical worst-case performance of O(n²), this is rare in real-world scenarios.

Discuss why Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort
Quick Sort is generally favored over Bubble Sort due to its significantly better performance, especially when dealing with larger datasets. The primary reason for this preference lies in their time complexity. Quick Sort boasts an average time complexity of O(nlogn), meaning its execution time grows much more slowly as the number of elements (n) increases. It achieves this efficiency by employing a "divide and conquer" strategy, recursively breaking down the array into smaller sub-problems. In contrast, Bubble Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n 
2). This quadratic growth makes it exceedingly slow for larger inputs; for instance, sorting 1,000 items with Bubble Sort could involve a million operations, whereas Quick Sort might only require around 10,000. While Bubble Sort is simple to understand and implement, its inefficiency stems from its method of repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements one by one. This localized approach leads to many unnecessary comparisons and swaps, severely limiting its practical application compared to Quick Sort's more sophisticated and efficient partitioning method.

Bubble Sort, with its O(n²) complexity, is simply too slow to be practical for anything but the smallest lists or for educational purposes. Therefore, Quick Sort is the industry standard because it's fast, efficient, and reliable for real-world applications.
